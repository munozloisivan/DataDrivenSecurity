It is commonly found on Linux and Unix systems.
 
The Debian OpenSSL package is prone to a random number generator weakness which causes the keys generated by this package to be predictable.","Attackers can exploit this issue to predict random data used to generate encryption keys by certain applications. An attacker can record encrypted sessions (SSL,SSH, VPN) then in an off-line mode use a library of weak keys to find out the private key values used by the communication parties and decrypt the encrypted traffic. Specifically affected keys include RSA, SSH, OpenVPN and DNSSEC keys as well as X.509 certificates and session keys used in the SSL/TLS sessions.
 
Attackers may exploit this issue to potentially compromise encryption keys and gain access to sensitive data. This may aid in further attacks. In the case of SSH attackers can gain full access to the target system.
 
This issue affects only a modified OpenSSL package for Debian prior to Version 0.9.8c-4etch3.
 
Please note that the keys that were generated on a vulnerable system and then moved to a different non-Debian system are still vulnerable and can cause a compromise of that non-Debian system.","The vendor has released updates to address this issue. See the references for more information.
 
The Results section contains identifications for the weak keys detected on the target system. The keys are identified by calculating a hash over the public key. The hash function as well as the information the hash function is calculated upon is different for SSH and SSL keys. 
 
For SSL the following command can be used to calculate the hash of a key in a X.509 certificate:
 
openssl x509 -in [cert name.pem]  -modulus -noout|openssl sha1
 
For an SSH key the following command can be used to obtain the hash of the public key:
 
ssh-keygen -f [SSH public key file name.pub] -l
 
All the keys listed in the Results section are weak and need to be regenerated on a non-vulnerable  or patched system. In the case of certificates, they need to be regenerated and signed again.

SSL encryption ciphers are classified based on the encryption key length as follows: 
 
 HIGH - key length larger than 128 bits
 MEDIUM - key length equal to 128 bits
 LOW - key length smaller than 128 bits
 
During the SSL handshake, the SSL client and the SSL server negotiate which cipher to use for the session. The SSL server chooses a cipher from a list proposed by the SSL client. The list is sorted by preference with the first cipher in the list being the most preferred.

  This vulnerability is reported when the list of ciphers submitted by the client has a mixture of LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH ciphers with a LOW grade cipher listed first, and the SSL server chooses to use the LOW grade cipher
even though it supports at least one MEDIUM or HIGH grade cipher in the list.
 
Messages encrypted with LOW encryption ciphers are easy to decrypt. Commercial SSL servers should only support MEDIUM or HIGH strength ciphers to guarantee transaction security. SSL servers support a LOW grade cipher even though the client supports stronger ciphers.","An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to decrypt secure communications without authorization.","Disable support for LOW encryption ciphers.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that the there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which make statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples, that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS.

They provide these services by using encryption for privacy, x509 certificates for authenticity and one-way hash functions for integrity. To encrypt data SSL and TLS can use block ciphers, which are encryption algorithms that can encrypt only a fixed block of original data to an encrypted block of the same size. Note that these ciphers will always obtain the same resulting block for the same original block of data. To achieve difference in the output the output of encryption is XORed with yet another block of the same size referred to as initialization vectors (IV). A special mode of operation for block ciphers known as CBC (cipher block chaining) uses one IV for the initial block and the result of the previous block for each subsequent block to obtain difference in the output of block cipher encryption.
 
In SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0 implementation the choice CBC mode usage was poor because the entire traffic shares one CBC session with single set of initial IVs. The rest of the IV are as mentioned above results of the encryption of the previous blocks. The subsequent IV are available to the eavesdroppers. This allows an attacker with the capability to inject arbitrary traffic into the plain-text stream (to be encrypted by the client) to verify their guess of the plain-text preceding the injected block. If the attackers guess is correct then the output of the encryption will be the same for two blocks.
 For low entropy data it is possible to guess the plain-text block with relatively few number of attempts. For example for data that has 1000 possibilities the number of attempts can be 500.

 NOTE: 
The CVSS access complexity assigned by NIST to CVE-2011-3389 is 'Medium' which makes the base score 4.3. But Qualys has assigned access complexity to 'High' for server side, because Javascipt injection and MiTM capabilities and a vulnerable client are required to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore the Qualys CVSS score is 2.6.","Recently attacks against the web authentication cookies have been described which used this vulnerability. If the authentication cookie is guessed by the attacker then the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user on the Web site which accepts the authentication cookie.","This attack was identified in 2004 and later revisions of TLS protocol which contain a fix for this. If possible, upgrade to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. If upgrading to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 is not possible, then disabling CBC mode ciphers will remove the vulnerability.
 
Setting your SSL server to prioritize RC4 ciphers mitigates this vulnerability. Microsoft has posted information including workarounds for IIS at KB2588513 (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2588513).
 
Using the following SSL configuration in Apache mitigates this vulnerability:

Qualys SSL/TLS Deployment Best Practices can be found here (https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/best-practices/).

 
Note: RC4 recommendation is only in situations where upgrade to TLSv1.2 is not possible. RC4 in TLS v1.0 has output bias problem as described in QID 38601. Therefore it is recommended to upgrade to TLS v1.2 or later.",,,"Available non CBC cipher	Server's choice	SSL version

SSL encryption ciphers are classified based on the encryption key length as follows: 
 
 HIGH - key length larger than 128 bits
 MEDIUM - key length equal to 128 bits
 LOW - key length smaller than 128 bits
 
During the SSL handshake, the SSL client and the SSL server negotiate which cipher to use for the session. The SSL server chooses a cipher from a list proposed by the SSL client. The list is sorted by preference with the first cipher in the list being the most preferred.

  This vulnerability is reported when the list of ciphers submitted by the client has a mixture of LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH ciphers with a LOW grade cipher listed first, and the SSL server chooses to use the LOW grade cipher
even though it supports at least one MEDIUM or HIGH grade cipher in the list.
 
Messages encrypted with LOW encryption ciphers are easy to decrypt. Commercial SSL servers should only support MEDIUM or HIGH strength ciphers to guarantee transaction security. SSL servers support a LOW grade cipher even though the client supports stronger ciphers.","An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to decrypt secure communications without authorization.","Disable support for LOW encryption ciphers.

  If for some reason LOW grade cipher are needed, then using the SSLHonorCipherOrder directive will enforce the server's preference on cipher selection and will guarantee that weak ciphers will be used only if nothing else is available.

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that the there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which make statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples, that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible.

They provide these services by using encryption for privacy, x509 certificates for authenticity and one-way hash functions for integrity. To encrypt data SSL and TLS can use block ciphers, which are encryption algorithms that can encrypt only a fixed block of original data to an encrypted block of the same size. Note that these ciphers will always obtain the same resulting block for the same original block of data. To achieve difference in the output the output of encryption is XORed with yet another block of the same size referred to as initialization vectors (IV). A special mode of operation for block ciphers known as CBC (cipher block chaining) uses one IV for the initial block and the result of the previous block for each subsequent block to obtain difference in the output of block cipher encryption.
 
In SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0 implementation the choice CBC mode usage was poor because the entire traffic shares one CBC session with single set of initial IVs. The rest of the IV are as mentioned above results of the encryption of the previous blocks. The subsequent IV are available to the eavesdroppers. This allows an attacker with the capability to inject arbitrary traffic into the plain-text stream (to be encrypted by the client) to verify their guess of the plain-text preceding the injected block. If the attackers guess is correct then the output of the encryption will be the same for two blocks.
 For low entropy data it is possible to guess the plain-text block with relatively few number of attempts. For example for data that has 1000 possibilities the number of attempts can be 500.

 NOTE: 
The CVSS access complexity assigned by NIST to CVE-2011-3389 is 'Medium' which makes the base score 4.3. But Qualys has assigned access complexity to 'High' for server side, because Javascipt injection and MiTM capabilities and a vulnerable client are required to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore the Qualys CVSS score is 2.6.","Recently attacks against the web authentication cookies have been described which used this vulnerability. If the authentication cookie is guessed by the attacker then the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user on the Web site which accepts the authentication cookie.","This attack was identified in 2004 and later revisions of TLS protocol which contain a fix for this. If possible, upgrade to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. If upgrading to TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 is not possible, then disabling CBC mode ciphers will remove the vulnerability.
 
Setting your SSL server to prioritize RC4 ciphers mitigates this vulnerability. Microsoft has posted information including workarounds for IIS at KB2588513 (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2588513).

TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.  
 
The cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range, known as the acknowledgement range, of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size, which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput, but the larger the TCP window size, the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution, making this type of attack impractical. However, some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number, making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations.
 
This is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option, as described in RFC 1323, to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion.
 
This vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session, causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port.
 
There are a few factors that may present viable target implementations, such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections, those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result, this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms.
 
Another factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions, as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order, dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others.
 
It should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products, investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further.","Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.","Please first check the results section below for the port number on which this vulnerability was detected.

This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
 
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site's domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it's possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
 
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
 
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
 
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
 
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance.","If this vulnerability is successfully exploited, users of the Web server may lose their authentication credentials for the server and/or for the Web applications hosted by the server to an attacker. This may be the case even if the Web applications are not vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks due to input validation errors.","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor's documentation.
 
 Apache : Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the 'AddModule' and 'LoadModule' directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request's contents are echoed back.
 
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 

 Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
 In the httpd.conf add or modify:
 
TraceEnable Off
 

 
 Microsoft IIS : Microsoft released URLScan (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608), which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases 'TRACK' to 'TRACE'. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
 
URLScan uses the 'urlscan.ini' configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove 'TRACK', 'TRACE' methods from the 'AllowVerbs' section and add them to the 'DenyVerbs' section. With this, URLScan will disallow all 'TRACE' and 'TRACK' methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the 'World Wide Web Publishing Service' from the 'Services' Control Panel item.

X-Frame-Options: This HTTP response header improves the protection of web applications against clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page.  
X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. 
X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. 
QID Detection Logic: 
This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose.

This unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: 
Valid directives for X-Frame-Options are: 
X-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. 
X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. 
Valid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: 
X-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. 
X-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. 
A valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
A valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] 
 NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks."," Note:  To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose. 
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A ""missing"" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An ""insufficient"" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ""ignored"" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. 
Customers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. 
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: 
X-Frame-Options: 
Apache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN 
nginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; 
HAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN 
IIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=""X-Frame-Options"" VALUE=""SAMEORIGIN""></ADD></CUSTOMHEADERS></HTTPPROTOCOL> 
X-XSS-Protection: 
Apache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection ""1; mode=block""  
PHP: header(""X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block""); 
X-Content-Type-Options: 
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security: 
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"" 
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; 
 Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers. This is a known issue and it is recommend to contact the vendor for a solution.",,,"X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors HTTP Headers missing on port 8443.

This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
 
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site's domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it's possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
 
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
 
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
 
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
 
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance.","If this vulnerability is successfully exploited, users of the Web server may lose their authentication credentials for the server and/or for the Web applications hosted by the server to an attacker. This may be the case even if the Web applications are not vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks due to input validation errors.","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor's documentation.
 
 Apache : Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the 'AddModule' and 'LoadModule' directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request's contents are echoed back.
 
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
</IfModule>
 

 Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
 In the httpd.conf add or modify:
 
TraceEnable Off
 

 
 Microsoft IIS : Microsoft released URLScan (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608), which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases 'TRACK' to 'TRACE'. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
 
URLScan uses the 'urlscan.ini' configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove 'TRACK', 'TRACE' methods from the 'AllowVerbs' section and add them to the 'DenyVerbs' section. With this, URLScan will disallow all 'TRACE' and 'TRACK' methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the 'World Wide Web Publishing Service' from the 'Services' Control Panel item.

A cache management feature for Apache makes use of an entity tag (ETag) header. When this option is enabled and a request is made for a document relating to a file, an ETag response header is returned containing various file attributes for caching purposes. ETag information allows subsequent file requests to contain specific information, such as the file's inode number.
 
A weakness has been found in the generation of ETag headers under certain configurations implementing the FileETag directive. Among the file attributes included in the header is the file inode number that is returned to a client. 
 
 Affected Versions:  
By default, all Versions of Apache are vulnerable. 
 
In Apache Versions 1.3.22 and earlier, it's not possible to disable inodes in in ETag headers to mitigate this vulnerability, so Apache Version 1.3.22 and earlier are vulnerable at all times.

 For Apache 1.3.23 and later: 
In Apache Version 1.3.23 (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/core.htmlfileetag) and later, it's possible to configure the FileETag directive to generate ETag headers without inode information, which mitigates this vulnerability. 
To do so, include ""FileETag -INode"" in the Apache server configuration file for a specific subdirectory. 
In order to fix this vulnerability globally, for the Web server, use the option ""FileETag None"". Use the option ""FileETag

 OpenBSD:  
OpenBSD has released a patch (ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.2/common/008_httpd.patch) that fixes this vulnerability. After installing the patch, inode numbers returned from the server are encoded using a private hash to avoid the release of sensitive information.",,,"GET / HTTP/1.0

 For Apache 1.3.23 and later: 
In Apache Version 1.3.23 (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/core.htmlfileetag) and later, it's possible to configure the FileETag directive to generate ETag headers without inode information, which mitigates this vulnerability. 
To do so, include ""FileETag -INode"" in the Apache server configuration file for a specific subdirectory. 
In order to fix this vulnerability globally, for the Web server, use the option ""FileETag None"". Use the option ""FileETag
MTime Size"" if you just want to remove the Inode information.
 
 OpenBSD:  
OpenBSD has released a patch (ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.2/common/008_httpd.patch) that fixes this vulnerability. After installing the patch, inode numbers returned from the server are encoded using a private hash to avoid the release of sensitive information.",,,"GET / HTTP/1.0

OpenSSL contains the following vulnerabilities: 
 CVE-2014-0224: An attacker using a carefully crafted handshake can force the use of weak keying material in OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can decrypt and modify traffic from the attacked client and server.

 3. Then the scanner sends a ChangeCipherSpec message. This message is out-of-order. 
 4. The fixed version of openssl will reject this message with an alert ""Unexpected message"". The vulnerable version will attempt to proceed with the incomplete session. It will fail because of the missing shared key and return an alert ""Decryption failed"". The target would be vulnerable because it shouldn't even have proceeded to the point where it attempted to decrypt anything.
 
The QID results of ""Expecting Unexpected Message Alert(0x0A)"" means the target attempted to decrypt and did NOT send the expected Unexpected Message alert.","Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, run arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on the targeted system.","Customers are advised to install OpenSSL versions 0.9.8za, 1.0.0m, 1.0.1h (http://openssl.org/source/old/) or later to remediate this vulnerability.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

The result is given in the Result section below.

The Microsoft SMB Server is vulnerable to multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities due to the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) server handles certain requests. 
 
This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows 8, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, Windows 8.1 and RT 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.
 
 UPDATE: 14 May 2017. Signature for this QID has been updated to detect the patch released by Microsoft for end-of-life operating systems Windows XP, Windows 2003 and Windows 8.
 
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated): 
This QID connects the remote server's ""IPC$"" then sends a ""PeekNamedPipe"" SMB request with ""FID = 0"" to the remote target. Vulnerable system should return ""STATUS_INSUFF_SERVER_RESOURCES"" in the SMB status code.

It's principal purpose is to provide a protocol layer able to inform gateways of the inter-connectivity and accessibility of other gateways or hosts.

However, you should never filter  ALL  ICMP messages, as some of them (""Don't Fragment"", ""Destination Unreachable"", ""Source Quench"", etc) are necessary for proper behavior of Operating System TCP/IP stacks.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that the there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which make statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples, that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that the there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which make statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.
 
The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples, that can be used for statistical analysis.

 NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","If this attack is carried out and an HTTP cookie is recovered, then the attacker can use the cookie to impersonate the user whose cookie was recovered.
 
This attack is not very practical as it requires the attacker to have access to millions of samples of ciphertext, but there are certain assumptions that an attacker can make to improve the chances of recovering the cleartext from cihpertext. For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","RC4 should not be used where possible.

RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs).

NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB).

TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.  
 
The cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range, known as the acknowledgement range, of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size, which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput, but the larger the TCP window size, the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution, making this type of attack impractical. However, some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number, making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations.
 
This is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option, as described in RFC 1323, to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion.
 
This vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session, causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port.
 
There are a few factors that may present viable target implementations, such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections, those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result, this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms.
 
Another factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions, as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order, dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others.
 
It should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products, investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further.","Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.","Please first check the results section below for the port number on which this vulnerability was detected. If that port number is known to be used for port-forwarding, then it is the backend host that is really vulnerable.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include ""MIB_II.system.sysDescr"" for the operating system.","Not  applicable.","Not  applicable.",,,"Operating System	Technique	ID

TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.  
 
The cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range, known as the acknowledgement range, of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size, which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput, but the larger the TCP window size, the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution, making this type of attack impractical. However, some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number, making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations.
 
This is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option, as described in RFC 1323, to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion.
 
This vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session, causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port.
 
There are a few factors that may present viable target implementations, such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections, those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result, this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms.
 
Another factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions, as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order, dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others.
 
It should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products, investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further.","Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.","Please first check the results section below for the port number on which this vulnerability was detected. If that port number is known to be used for port-forwarding, then it is the backend host that is really vulnerable.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.
 
1)  TCP/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this ""fingerprinting"" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. 
 
Note that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.
 
2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). 
 
3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.
 
4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers.
